        and a sibling of "controls". I can think of this like a family tree, 
        and as I move down, subsequesnt children spread out. -->

        <!-- Event Bubbling:    If I click the button 2, the button element gets the
                signal, and then it "bubbles up" to the div,
                then to the body, then to the html, then to the Document itself. 
                Modern browsers also bubble to a "window" object
                
                Event Capturing goes backwards: Window -> document -> 
                html -> body -> div -> button
        
                what happens when someone performs an event is:
                event capture happens, then the event at the element it was applied to,
                then it bubbles back up.  -->
