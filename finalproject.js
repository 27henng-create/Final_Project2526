// This is my code for my Final Project in Programming 1
// Hangman Game:
    // Have a "solo" and a "multiplayer" gamemode 
    // Solo Mode:
        // Give computer many words for it to choose
        // Have the computer recognize how many letters are in the word that is chosen
        // Give the player 6 strikes if they guess wrong 6 times

    // Multiplayer Mode:
    // Let the player put in a 'secret word' and store it and have the player guess it

    // OPTIONAL: Have many different themes like "video game characters", "phrases", etc.
